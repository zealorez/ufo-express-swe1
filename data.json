Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.",

I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.",
